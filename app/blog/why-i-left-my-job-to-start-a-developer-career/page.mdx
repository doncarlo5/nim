# Why I Left My Stable Job to Pursue a Developer Career

Five years into my role at Saint-Gobain, I handed in my resignation to chase a career in tech. Here’s why I traded security for code—and how I’m navigating this radical pivot.

## The Catalyst: When Comfort Became a Cage

### Why I Walked Away
- **No Growth Trajectory**: Limited upward mobility despite strong performance.
- **Misaligned Purpose**: Felt disconnected from the company’s core mission.
- **Family Influence**: Two brothers in tech showed me the possibilities of remote work and creative problem-solving.

### The Final Push
After a rejected internal transfer request, I activated France’s **Professional Transition Project (PTP)** to fund my retraining. The bureaucracy of corporate life cemented my decision:  
🔸 40+ hrs/week in meetings  
🔸 Zero autonomy over projects  
🔸 No tangible impact metrics

## Building the Bridge: Skills, Research, and Sacrifices

### Transferable Assets I Bring
| Technical Skills | Soft Skills |
|------------------|-------------|
| PC Assembly/Repair | Client Needs Analysis |
| Basic Web Dev (HTML/CSS) | Project Management |
| Tech Troubleshooting | Public Speaking |

### Reality Checks I Faced
- **Salary Drop**: From €4,055/month to junior dev rates (~€35k/year)
- **Lifestyle Shifts**: Sedentary work vs. previous on-site role
- **Learning Curve**: 9-week Ironhack bootcamp requires 60+ hr weeks

### My 3-Point Preparation Strategy
1. **Network Mining**: 6 coffee chats with developers (including 2 freelancers)
2. **Portfolio Development**: Built 4 demo projects (see [GitHub](https://github.com/jthomas-projects))
3. **Financial Buffer**: Saved 6 months’ expenses + Transition Pro’s 90% salary coverage
